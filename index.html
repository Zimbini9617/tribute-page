              Nikola Tesla is born Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at
              midnight. During his birth, lightning struck during a summer
              storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed
              `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said, his mother replied
              to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`. He was born
              based on the conventional Slavonic rites, and his birth records
              show he was born on July 28th. Tesla was the fourth child in a
              family of five children. The family comprised of three sisters
              including Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was
              known as Dane. Dane died when Tesla was still at a tender age.
              Tesla attended his early education in 1861 in Smiljan, where he
              acquired various skills including arithmetic and he also mastered
              the German Language. The following year, Nikola Tesla moved to a
              place known as Gospic. Here, his father played the role of a
              Parish Pastor.

              Tesla's Brush With Death Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as
              Karlovac to complete his high school. Three years later, he went
              back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted
              cholera. He was in hospital for close to one year, and he faced
              near-death circumstances.

              Tesla Enrolls In College In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic
              based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and
              achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams.
              More so, he also started a cultural club and received a letter of
              commendation from the dean of the Technical Department. During his
              second year, he got into an argument with one his professors over
              the functionality of the Gramme dynamo.

              Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy Tesla’s uncle collected
              money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He
              arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in
              Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the classes he
              wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the
              university, though he did not receive grades for the courses.

              Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer In 1881, he
              moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company.
              Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange
              company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another
              company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and
              he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. During his
              tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved
              the performance of the company.

              Tesla Goes To Work For Edison In 1882, he found another job in
              Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison
              Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor
              lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he
              worked in the section of the company that was responsible for
              lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical
              engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and
              soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos
              and motors. Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA. In
              1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to
              manage a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started
              a manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for
              Tesla to be relocated to the country as well. In the same year,
              Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working immediately.

              Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents In March 1885, he met with
              an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of
              various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen,
              including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed to help
              finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla
              worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing
              an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass
              media who sought his solutions.

              Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor In 1887, Tesla came up with
              an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a
              form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This
              type of power provided various benefits, especially in
              long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was
              operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating
              magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric
              motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic
              self-starting design that did not require the use of commutators.
              As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high
              maintenance that was associated with replacing mechanical brushes

              Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission After 1890,
              Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by
              inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC
              voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried
              in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was
              based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed
              various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler
              tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over
              a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting

              Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he
              became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he also
              patented his famous Tesla Coil.

              Tesla's Death In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room
              in New York. He died alone, and his body was found by a maid who
              ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant
              medical professional evaluated the body and determined the cause
              of death was related to coronary complications. A few days after
              the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G
              Trump was called in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known
              electrical engineer who worked for the state, which was held in
              custody. Following a three day investigation, a Trumps report
              concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in
              unfriendly circumstances.
